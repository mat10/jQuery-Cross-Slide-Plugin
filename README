This is the jQuery Cross-Slide plugin, originally written by Tobia Conforto.

He sent me the latest version of his plugin, so the plugin can get a new home, if I'm willing to continue development on it. Tobia had to stop working on it.

Unfortunately I am not that much of an jQuery plugin expert, so I decided to put it on GitHub so it doesn't get lost. Feel free to take part!
